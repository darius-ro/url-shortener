# URL Shortener
A simple URL Shortener that tracks visits.
This was made as my first github repo, nothing big.

# How to run

You need to have (NodeJS)[https://nodejs.org/] installed to run this.

Open a terminal in this project by downloading/cloning the repo to your machine.

Install the modules required to run this:

```bash
npm i
```

Before running the program, head over to .env.example and copy it to .env,
then modify the file to contain valid credentials to a (MongoDB)[https://mongodb.com] server that could store your shortened urls!

To then run the program run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

# Development

If you want to modify the code you can use the following command to rerun the program when changes are saved.

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Changes

If you want to modify my program and do a request to change the main repo, I won't mind, however, I will not be personally updating this.

Hope you enjoy this open source project.
